# What This Is

This is a clear, testable model of awareness and identity.

No belief is required.
No mysticism is assumed.
Nothing here needs to be “accepted.”

It is something you can **verify in your own direct experience**.

Awareness (0) is the still center.
Identity (1) is a temporary perspective.
1/0 is identity resting in awareness.
The hypercube is the space of all possible identity configurations.

Everything else is commentary.
