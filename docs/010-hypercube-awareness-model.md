# Hypercube Awareness Model

- **0** — Awareness (no position, no story, no form)
- **1** — Identity (a perspective, not the self)
- **1/0** — Identity resting in awareness (presence)
- **Hypercube** — The space of all possible identity configurations

Attention “folds” the hypercube into a single identity configuration.

Returning to awareness is instantaneous.
