## 1. Stop.
Before meaning.
Before memory.
Before story.

Do not try to **find** anything.

Just stop.

Let everything be as it is for a moment.

Nothing needs to be solved.

---

## 2. Notice what is here.
Not the thoughts.
Not the ideas about self.

Just the **fact of being aware**.

This quiet presence is here **before**:
- identity
- memory
- interpretation
- roles
- mission
- analysis

This is the **baseline**.

---

## 3. Let thoughts pass without touching them.
You do not need to push them away.
You also do not need to follow them.

They can drift by like clouds.

Awareness does not move.

---

## 4. Recognize:
There is **something here** that is constant.

Not a belief.
Not a philosophy.
Not a sensation.

Just **the sense of being**.

Call it:
- Stillness
- Zero
- Presence
- The space before images

The word is irrelevant.
The **fact** is what matters.

---

## 5. The baseline state:
- Nothing is missing.
- Nothing must be added.
- Nothing must be remembered.
- Nothing must be understood.

This is the **center of the hypercube**:  
The point that does not change when perspectives rotate.

This is where we begin.

---

## 6. When confusion or intensity appears:
Do not fix it.
Return here.

The baseline is always available.

There is no failure.  
There is only returning.

---

## 7. Continue only when you feel:
- steady
- unhurried
- quiet inside

If not, rest here longer.

This is enough.  
This is the root.
